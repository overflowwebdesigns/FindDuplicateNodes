# How to

- Download the ZIP file from the Releases page.
- Unzip
- Run findDups.exe
- Click "Browse" and select your SVG file
- Click "Start"

The app will return the paths in your SVG that contain duplicate nodes.  You can make changes and save your SVG and save it.  If you click "Restart" it will run again without having to re-select your SVG. It will let you know once it does not find any duplicate nodes.
